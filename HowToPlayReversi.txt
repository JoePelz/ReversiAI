Game Rules
============

Reversi is a two-player game.

- Players take turns playing a single token at a time.
- When you play your token, 
	if your play makes it so you have tokens on both ends 
	of a line of enemy tokens, you capture those them 
	and they become your color.
- You can only play where it would capture at least one of the enemy's tokens.

The player with the most tokens at the end wins!
